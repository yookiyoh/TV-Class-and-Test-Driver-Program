# TV-Class-and-Test-Driver-Program
This programming task entails creating a Python application that comprises of two crucial components: a TV class and a TestTV driver program.

Program Description
--
This is a programming assignment that necessitates the development of a Python application which defines two distinct parts: a TV class and a TestTV driver program. The TV class simulates a television and should comprise of attributes and methods that enable users to manage its operation. The TestTV driver program is responsible for instantiating two TV objects, with additional instructions to validate the behavior of the TV class methods. Proficiency in Python programming language and knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are required to fulfill the task requirements. The completed application will be capable of generating multiple instances of TV objects, and its TestTV driver program will be able to test the functionality of the TV class.
